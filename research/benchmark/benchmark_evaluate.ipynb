This likely means the effective date is missing from most contracts. I can refine the search if you provide a date range to look within.   \n",

This likely means the effective date is missing from most contracts. I can refine the search if you provide a date range to look within.  \n",

I do not have the ability to sum all monetary values. However, I can provide the monetary values of individual contracts. Would you like me to search for contracts involving WebMD, Inc. and list their individual monetary values?  \n",

To provide a specific list of parties that appear in both types of contracts, I would need to perform a more complex search. Would you like me to perform the search to identify parties involved in both contract types?  \n",

However, I can search for contracts with a min_end_date greater than 5 years from the min_effective_date. Would you like me to do that? What would be the earliest effective date you want to use?  \n",

I can search for contracts with a minimum end date. However, I cannot filter by duration. I recommend you provide a minimum end date, and I can search for the contracts. Would you like me to do that?  \n",
