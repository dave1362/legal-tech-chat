I do not have the ability to directly query for a list of countries. Would you like me to proceed with a Cypher query that aggregates party counts by country, or do you have another approach in mind? Keep in mind that the Cypher query will need to be crafted without specific knowledge of available countries.   \n",

However, I can search for IP contracts and include a custom Cypher aggregation to calculate the average monetary value. Would you like me to proceed with this approach?   \n",

Is that simply the monetary value listed in the contract, or do you have a more complex calculation in mind that I could perform with a Cypher aggregation?  If it is simply the monetary value, please provide the operator and value.   \n",
