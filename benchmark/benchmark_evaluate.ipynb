However, typically, this kind of information requires access to specific data on contracts within a company's repository or database where such records are kept. If your organization keeps a log of contract details, you might want to refer to that system for precise insights. Additionally, legal counsel or the contracts management team may have this data readily available or could assist in providing this information based on past contract experiences.   \n",

However, typically, this kind of information requires access to specific data on contracts within a company's repository or database where such records are kept. If your organization keeps a log of contract details, you might want to refer to that system for precise insights. Additionally, legal counsel or the contracts management team may have this data readily available or could assist in providing this information based on past contract experiences.   \n",
